# Hello, humans ðŸ‘‹
I'm Valdigleis (Dk4LL), a [Peanuts](https://www.peanuts.com/) fan, former programmer, ex-user and ex-collaborator of the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) project. Currently, I'm a computer science teacher at [CCICOMP](https://portais.univasf.edu.br/ccicomp) of the [Univasf](https://www.univasf.edu.br) - Brazil. This repository contains my personal config used in the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

## Basic items on system ðŸŒ±
Install on your system...

- The [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor, obviously!
- A [Nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), particularly recommend the font: [FiraMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/FiraMono.zip).
- The plugin manager [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## Languages ðŸ’¬
This configuration provides support for the following listed languages:

- **Bash** using the [bash-language-server](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server), tested with the version **5.4.2**.
- **C** and **C++** using the language server [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/), tested with the version **14.0.0**.

## Dependencies (Softwares) ðŸ“¦
For this configuration to work correctly, in addition to the language servers mentioned in the previous section, you must have the following software in your system's PATH.

- The shell [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).
- A line-oriented search tool that recursively searches, called [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
- The reader files sequentially, writing them to standard output, called [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat).
- The parser generator tool called [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).
- A compiler C/C++ for compile files for the tree-sitter, options are: [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
